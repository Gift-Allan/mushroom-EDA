# Final Report: Mushroom Classification Project

## Introduction
This project aimed to classify mushrooms as edible (0) or poisonous (1) using the Mushroom Classification Dataset, applying data science methodology across four milestones.

## Milestone 1: Data Preprocessing and EDA
- **Preprocessing**: The dataset (8124 rows, 23 columns) had no missing values. All categorical features were label-encoded for modeling.
- **EDA Insights**: 
  - Class distribution: ~52% edible, ~48% poisonous (balanced).
  - Features like 'odor,' 'gill-color,' and 'spore-print-color' showed strong visual separation between classes (e.g., foul odor linked to poisonous mushrooms).
  - Correlation heatmap indicated some feature relationships, guiding modeling.

## Milestone 2: Modeling
- **Model**: Trained a Random Forest Classifier (100 trees) on an 80/20 train-test split.
- **Performance**: Achieved 100% accuracy on the test set, suggesting clear feature-class patterns.

## Milestone 3: Model Evaluation
- **Metrics**: Random Forest scored 1.0 in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for both classes. Logistic Regression (baseline) scored slightly lower (e.g., 0.95 accuracy).
- **Validation**: 5-fold CV F1-score for Random Forest was 1.0 ± 0.0, confirming robustness.
- **Best Model**: Random Forest was selected for its perfect performance and ability to capture feature interactions.

## Milestone 4: Interpretation and Insights
- **Key Features**: 'odor' (highest importance), 'gill-color,' and 'spore-print-color' were top predictors, aligning with EDA findings.
- **Errors**: No misclassifications in the test set, indicating the dataset’s features perfectly distinguish classes.
- **Insights**: 
  - Mushrooms with foul, pungent, or fishy odors are almost certainly poisonous.
  - Spore print color (e.g., chocolate, black) and gill color (e.g., buff) are strong indicators of toxicity.# Milestone 4: Interpretation and Final Report

## Recommendations
- **Practical Use**: This model could guide foragers, but real-world validation with diverse species is needed.
- **Future Work**: Test on unseen mushroom species and explore simpler models for deployment (e.g., decision trees) if computational resources are limited.

## Conclusion
The Random Forest model perfectly classified mushrooms, leveraging key features like odor and spore print color. This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in solving practical classification tasks with clear, interpretable results.
